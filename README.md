  > :raised_hand: Everything outside of this callout, and the link to the walkthrough below, was generated using this very generator. Meta, eh?!


  ## Description
  A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file, from a user's input, using Node.js and Inquirer.

  ## Installation
  Node.js 18.x or higher and Inquirer 8.x, found on `npm`.

  ## Usage
  Open your CLI and navigate to the folder containing `index.mjs`. Next, type `node index.mjs`, and answer the questions as prompted in the command-line. Once completed, your `README.md` will be generated, using your answers, and can be found in the same directory.

  > :computer: You can check out [this walkthrough video](https://youtu.be/8xXoBW6mb9A) which demonstrates the app in use - generating this very README you are reading (excluding the two callouts and gif)! The gif below is the same content as the video linked above.
